This Scrabble game implementation features a simplified single-line board
with 7 squares, including special bonus squares (double/triple letter/word scores).
Players can drag letter tiles from their rack to form words on the board, with
automatic scoring that accounts for letter values and square bonuses.
The game includes core functionality like submitting words, drawing new tiles,
and resetting the game, while enforcing basic Scrabble rules like adjacent tile placement.
The clean interface displays the current word, word score, and total score.
